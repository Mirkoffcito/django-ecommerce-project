# django-ecommerce-project
This is my ecommerce project with Django following the guide provided by VeryAcademy on his youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1mxuk7tuQT2D0qTMgKji3w)
Right now i'm through the second video, about to start the third video.
So far i've learned about using Ajax, how to return a json response, defining the models for the products and returning our objects to the template and making a functional shopping cart
